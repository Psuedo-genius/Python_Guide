# Why is indentation important in Python?
'''Python needs proper indentation to know which code belongs inside the block.
Standard = 4 spaces or 1 tab'''

if (5 > 3):
    print('Hello, World!')
    # Indentation is crucial for Python to understand the structure of the code.
if (3 > 5):
print('This statement will not be executed.')
# This will throw an error due to incorrect indentation.
