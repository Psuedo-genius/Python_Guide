# When should you avoid recursion in Python?
"""
When the input size is large (can hit recursion limit)

When an iterative solution is faster and simpler

When memory usage matters (recursion uses more)

When no proper base case is defined (can crash)

When doing tail recursion (Python doesn't optimize it)
